NAME
       CHI::Driver::Ping - Cache data in the Ether.

SYNOPSIS
         use CHI;

         $< == 0 or exec 'sudo', $0, @ARGV; # sending ICMPs requires root priv

         system 'sysctl', '-w', 'net.ipv4.icmp_ratelimit=100000';

         my $cache = CHI->new( driver => 'Ping', ip => 74.125.73.105 ); # google IP

DESCRIPTION
       Tap into the Ether.  Optimize for CPU or storage?  Fuck that.

       If you thought the Cloud was awesome, just wait until you try storing
       your data in the Ether.

       Inspired by Delay Line Memory,
       <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay_line_memory>, this modules stores
       data by transmitting it through a medium known to have a delay and
       waiting for it to come back again, whereupon it both returns it and
       retransmits it out again.

       It seems rather pointless and silly to bother with spinning metal oxide
       covered platters or billions of tiny capacitors when data can be stored
       in the air between the Earth and sattelites, in ordinary copper wire,
       and in easy to extrude lengths of glass fiber.

ATTRIBUTES
       ip  Who to send all of the ICMP ECHOPINGs to.

       namespace
           Not currently used (XXX).

TODO
       CIDR block of hosts to use, or a list, or something.  Even better, scan
       the network for hosts that are up and build this dynamically.  For
       extra points, find hosts with a lot of hops to them.

       namespace. XXX.

       remove. XXX.

       purge. XXX.
